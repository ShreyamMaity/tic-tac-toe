     This is a simple tic tac toe game.
        The game is played on a 3x3 board.
        The first player is X and the second player is O.
        The first player to get three in a row wins.
        The game is a draw if no player has three in a row and all squares are filled.
        The game is over when a player wins or the board is full.
